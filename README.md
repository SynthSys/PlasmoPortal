# PlasmoPortal
Code for web app supporting PlaSMo portal (plasmo.ed.ac.uk).

PlaSMo stands for Plant Systems-biology Modelling and the mission of the project was ensuring the achievements of yesterday's Mathematical Modellers will be available for the Systems Biologists of tomorrow. 

PlaSMo data has been migrated to the FaridoHub platform: https://fairdomhub.org/projects/129 and this repository contains snapshot of the code from the last version of the PlaSMo portal.

The portal implementation was "technologically outdated" so the code contained here is rather for archiving purposes than re-use.

PlaSmo portal is a typical Java Web Application build with Apache Struts2 and JSP.

# PlasmoPortal
Code for the web app supporting PlaSMo portal (plasmo.ed.ac.uk).

PlaSMo stands for Plant Systems-biology Modelling and the mission of the project was ensuring the achievements of yesterday's Mathematical Modellers will be available for the Systems Biologists of tomorrow. 

All PlaSMo data have been migrated to the FAIRDOMHub platform: https://fairdomhub.org/projects/129 and this repository contains a snapshot of the code from the last version of the PlaSMo portal.

The portal implementation was "technologically outdated" so the code contained here is intended for archiving purposes rather than re-use.

The PlaSMo portal is a typical Java Web Application build with Apache Struts2 and JSP.
